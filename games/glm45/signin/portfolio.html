    <h2>Experience</h2>
    
    <h3>02:12 - 05:15</h3>
    <div class="date-range">Document Transformation & Automation Specialist</div>
    
    <p>During this foundational period, I specialized in document transformation and automation solutions, focusing on the conversion of various word processing formats including RTF and proprietary FFF files into standardized XML structures. This role required deep expertise in Python scripting to develop robust parsing algorithms that could handle complex document structures while maintaining data integrity.</p>
    
    <p>I implemented sophisticated regular expression patterns and XML parsing libraries to extract, transform, and load content efficiently. Working in a Linux environment, I leveraged Git for version control to ensure code quality and collaboration with team members. The automation scripts I developed significantly reduced manual processing time by approximately 80% and improved accuracy in document conversion.</p>
    
    <p>This experience provided me with a strong foundation in data processing, file manipulation, and automation principles that would become increasingly valuable in my subsequent roles. I also gained exposure to enterprise-level document management systems and learned to optimize code for performance in high-volume processing environments. The challenges of handling diverse file formats taught me the importance of robust error handling and input validation in production systems.</p>

    <h3>08:15 - 04:18</h3>
    <div class="date-range">Full-Stack API Developer</div>
    
    <p>In this significant career phase, I transitioned into full-stack web development with a focus on building scalable API solutions using Django and Flask frameworks. I designed and implemented multiple RESTful APIs that served as the backbone for various client applications, handling everything from user authentication to complex data retrieval and processing.</p>
    
    <p>My responsibilities included database schema design, API endpoint development, and integration with frontend JavaScript applications. I gained extensive experience in cloud architecture, deploying applications on AWS EC2 instances and utilizing various AWS services for scalability and reliability. This role involved close collaboration with frontend developers to ensure seamless integration and optimal user experience.</p>
    
    <p>I implemented security best practices including JWT authentication, rate limiting, and input validation to protect against common web vulnerabilities. The projects I worked on served thousands of users daily, requiring me to focus heavily on performance optimization, caching strategies, and monitoring. I also gained experience in continuous integration and deployment pipelines, automating testing and deployment processes to improve development efficiency and reduce time-to-market for new features.</p>

    <h3>05:18 - 05:20</h3>
    <div class="date-range">DSP Server Developer & Ad Tech Specialist</div>
    
    <p>This period marked my entry into the dynamic world of digital advertising technology, where I played a key role in developing a Demand-Side Platform (DSP) server architecture. Working with open advertisement APIs, I designed and implemented systems capable of efficiently handling real-time bidding processes and advertisement slot management.</p>
    
    <p>The technical stack involved advanced Python development with Django and Flask frameworks, complemented by data processing using the pandas library for analytics and reporting. I leveraged AWS Lambda functions for serverless computing to handle peak loads and reduce infrastructure costs. The DSP system I helped build processes millions of advertisement requests daily, requiring sophisticated algorithms for bid optimization, inventory management, and real-time decision making.</p>
    
    <p>I gained deep understanding of programmatic advertising ecosystems, including header bidding, real-time bidding protocols, and advertisement exchange integrations. The role involved working with large datasets, implementing data pipelines, and creating analytics dashboards to provide insights into campaign performance. I also focused on system scalability, implementing microservices architecture and containerization to ensure the platform could handle growing traffic demands while maintaining low latency and high availability in the competitive advertising technology landscape.</p>
